    <h1>Primitive Data Types</h1>
    <p>
      A "symbol" represents a unique identifier. You can make use of Symbol() to
      generate a value of this type
    </p>
    <kbd> // empid is a new symbol let empid = Symbol(); </kbd>
    <p>
      Also, a description of the symbol generated can be provided which can be
      mostly used as a name during debugging. Example:
    </p>
    <kbd
      >// empid is a symbol with the description "empno" let empid =
      Symbol("empno");
    </kbd>
    <p>
      Even if various symbols are created with the same description, they are
      different values. Thus, symbols ensures uniqueness. So the description
      provided can be considered as just a label.
    </p>
    <kbd>
      let empid1 = Symbol("empno"); let empid2 = Symbol("empno"); alert(empid1==
      empid2); // false
    </kbd>
    <p>
      Here both the symbols have the same description but are never considered
      equal.
    </p>
    <p>Unlike other values, a symbol value doesn't follow auto-convert.</p>
    <kbd
      >let empid = Symbol("empno"); alert(empid); // TypeError: Cannot convert a
      Symbol value to a string
    </kbd>
    <p>
      This is a rule because strings and symbols are basically different and
      should not accidentally get converted to the other one. But if it is a
      must to display the Symbol, then the following can be done: Example:
    </p>
    <kbd>
      let empid = Symbol("empno"); alert(empid.toString()); // Symbol(empno),
      now it works OR //use description let empid = Symbol("empno");
      alert(empid.description); // empno
    </kbd>
    <p>
      Global symbols So far you know that symbols remain unique even if they
      have the same name. But at times, there may be a situation where you may
      want the symbols with same name to be same entities. In such a situation,
      symbols can be created in a global symbol registry and access them later
      and ensure that repeated accesses by the same name return exactly the same
      symbol. To read a symbol from the registry, use Symbol.for(key) which
      checks if thereâ€™s a symbol described as key, then returns it, otherwise
      creates a new symbol Symbol.for(key) and stores it in the registry by the
      given key.
    </p>
    <kbd
      >// read from the global registry let empid = Symbol.for("empno"); // if
      the symbol did not exist, it is created // read it again (maybe from
      another part of the code) let empidAgain= Symbol.for("empid"); // the same
      symbol alert( empid === empidAgain ); // false
    </kbd>
  </body>
