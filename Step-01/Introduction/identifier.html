    <h1>
      To model the real-world entities,they have to be named to use it in the
      JavaScript program
    </h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        Identifiers are those names that help in naming the elements in
        JavaScript.i.e firstName; placeOfVisit;
      </p>
    </div>
    <ul>
      Identifiers should follow below rules:
      <li>
        The first character of an identifier should be letters of the alphabet
        or an underscore (_) or dollar sign ($).
      </li>
      <li>
        Subsequent characters can be letters of alphabets or digits or
        underscores (_) or a dollar sign ($).
      </li>
      <li>
        Identifiers are case-sensitive. Hence, firstName and FirstName are not
        the same
      </li>
      <b>Note:</b
      >Reserved keywords are part of programming language syntax and cannot be
      used as identifiers.
    </ul>
    <p>
      The identifiers in JavaScript can be categorized into three as shown
      below. They can be declared into specific type based on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The data which an identifier will hold and</li>
      <li>The scope of the identifier</li>
      <ul>
        <li><b>let</b></li>
        <li><b>const</b></li>
        <li><b>var</b></li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>
      An identifier declared using ‘let’ keyword has a block scope i.e., it is
      available only within the block in which it is defined. The value assigned
      to the identifier can be done either at the time of declaration or later
      in the code and can also be altered further. All the identifiers known so
      far vary in their scope and with respect to the data it holds.
    </p>
    <kbd>
      let name="William"; console.log("Welcome to JS course, Mr."+name); let
      name = "Goth"; /* This will throw an error because the identifier 'name'
      has been already declared and we are redeclaring the variable, which is
      not allowed using the 'let' keyword. */ console.log("Welcome to JS course,
      Mr."+name);
    </kbd>
    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> As a best practice, use the let keyword for identifier
      declarations that will change their value over time or when the variable
      need not be accessed outside the code block. For example, in loops,
      looping variables can be declared using let as they are never used outside
      the block.
    </p>
    <p>
      The identifier to hold data that does not vary is called 'Constant' and to
      declare a constant, 'const' keyword is used, followed by an identifier.
      The value is initialized during the declaration itself and cannot be
      altered later. The identifiers declared using 'const' keyword have block
      scope i.e., they exist only in the block of code within which they are
      defined
    </p>
    <kbd>
      const pi = 3.14; console.log("The value of Pi is: "+pi); pi = 3.141592; /*
      This will throw an error because the assignment to a const needs to be
      done at the time of declaration and it cannot be re-initialized. */
      console.log("The value of Pi is: "+pi);
    </kbd>
    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> As a best practice, the const declaration can be used for
      string type identifiers or simple number, functions or classes which does
      not need to be changed or value
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, if A4 size paper is referred, then the dimension of the paper
      remains the same, but its colour can vary. The identifiers declared to
      hold data that vary are called 'Variables' and to declare a variable, the
      'var' keyword is optionally used. The value for the same can be
      initialized optionally. Once the value is initialized, it can be modified
      any number of times later in the program. Talking about the scope of the
      identifier declared using ‘var’ keyword, it takes the Function scope i.e.,
      it is globally available to the Function within which it has been declared
      and it is possible to declare the identifier name a second time in the
      same function.
    </p>
    <kbd
      >var name = "William"; console.log("Welcome to JS course, Mr." + name);
      var name = "Goth"; /* Here, even though we have redeclared the same
      identifier, it will not throw any error.*/ console.log("Welcome to JS
      course, Mr." + name);
    </kbd>
    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> As a best practice, use the 'var' keyword for variable
      declarations for function scope or global scope in the program.
