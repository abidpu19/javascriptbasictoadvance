    <h2>Javascript Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      avaScript was introduced as a full-fledged client-side language used for
      developing web applications in 1995. JavaScript is easy to learn, debug,
      and test. It is an event-based, platform-independent, and an interpreted
      language with all the procedural programming capabilities. Web
      applications that were developed using server-side programming languages
      like Java and Dot Net involved travel of user requests all the way from
      the client(browser) to the server hosting the application. The multiple
      request-response cycles between client and server who were consuming both
      time and network bandwidth. JavaScript got introduced as a Client-Side
      programming language with the capability of executing user requests on the
      Client-Side. This could help in reducing the number of request-response
      cycles between client and server and decrease the network bandwidth thus
      reducing the overall response time. Later, in 1997 ECMAScript established
      a standard for the scripting languages that redefined the core features
      any scripting language should have and how to implement those features.
      From then, JavaScript evolved year after year with every new version of
      ECMAScript introducing new features. Developers prefer JavaScript to
      create dynamic, interactive, and scalable web applications as it helps
      developers in extending the functionalities of the web pages effectively.
      This course will enable you to understand the features of ECMA and help to
      develop more robust web applications using JavaScript and handle user
      requests on the Client-Side. <b>Target audience: Developers</b>

    <h2>Refinement in JavaScript developement</h2>
    <ul>
      About ES6:
      <li>
        JavaScript was introduced as a client-side scripting language in 1995
      </li>
      <li>
        ECMAScript established a standard for scripting languages in 1997.
      </li>
      <li>
        ES is a parent of many scripting languages like TypeScript, JScript,
        ActionScript, and JavaScript.
      </li>
      <li>
        JavaScript evolved year after year with every new version of ECMAScript
        introducing new features
      </li>
      <li>ES6 also called ES2015.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      ES6 introduces new transformed syntax to extend existing JavaScript
      constructs to meet the demands of complex applications written in
      JavaScript. Below are some of the features that got introduced which
      extend the ability of JavaScript to ease the developer's web development
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Block scope variables using let and const keywords</li>
      <li>Template Literals</li>
      <li>Destructuring</li>
      <li>Arrow functions</li>
      <li>Enhanced for loop</li>
      <li>Default and Rest parameters</li>
      <li>Spread operator</li>
      <li>Classes and Objects</li>
      <li>Inheritance</li>
      <li>Native Promises</li>
      <li>Many other built-ins</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The applications which have been implemented in ES6 uses the best
      practices, new web standards, and cutting-edge features, without using
      additional frameworks or libraries. ES6 is also completely backward
      compatible. The features like Object Oriented support, New programming
      constructs, Modules, Templates, support for promises, etc. made ES6
      faster.

    <h2>JavaScript writting Style</h2>
    <p>
      The below-mentioned points can help you choose between any two ways of
      writing the script based on some parameters.
    </p>
    <table>
      <caption>
        Writting style of JavaScript
      </caption>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Standard</th>
          <th>Internal Script</th>
          <th>External Script</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Loading time</td>
          <td>Faster, as it is written within the HTML tage</td>
          <td>Slower, as it is loaded from server, whenever requested</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>When to use</td>
          <td>If number of lines of code is less</td>
          <td>For large amount of code</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Re-usable</td>
          <td>No, You can't re-use Javascript code with any other HTML file</td>
          <td>Yes, Same Javascript file can be used in multiple HTML files</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Code Maintainabilty</td>
          <td>
            Difficult, as for every change request, each HTML pages containing
            Javascript code has to be modified seprately
          </td>
          <td>Easy, as only 1 file needs to be modified</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> External scripting is used throughout this course.
      But due to the platform built-in feature,HTML code cannot be explicitly
      linked to external script using &lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt; tag. HTML
      code that are used to write is automatically linked to JavaScript code
      written on that page.
