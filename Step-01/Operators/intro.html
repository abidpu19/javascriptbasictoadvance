    <h3>Operators in a programming language are the symbols used to perform</h3>
    <p>
      operations on the values. Operands: Represents the data. Operator:
      Performs certain operations on the operands.
    </p>
    <kbd>let sum = 5 + 10; </kbd>
    <p>
      The statement formed using the operator and the operands are called
      Expression. In the above example, 5+10 is an expression. The values are
      termed as operands. The symbol ‘+’ is the operator which indicates which
      operation needs to be performed.
    </p>
    <h2>Types of Operators</h2>
    <p>
      Operators are categorized into unary, binary, and ternary based on the
      number of operands on which they operate in an expression. JavaScript
      supports the following types of operators:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <b>Types of Operators</b>
      <li>Arithmatic Operator</li>
      <li>Assignment Operator</li>
      <li>Comparision Operator</li>
      <li>Logical</li>
      <li>Conditional</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Arithmatic Operator</h2>
    <p>
      Arithmetic operators are used for performing arithmetic operations like
      addition (+), substruction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), Modolus
      (%) and uniray operator like increment (++) and decrement (--)
    </p>

    <p>
      Arithmetic operator '+' when used with string type results in the
      concatenation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arithmetic operator ‘+’ when used with a string value and a numeric value,
      it results in a new string value.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Assignment operators are used for assigning values to the variables.
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Assignment =</li>
      <li>Increment and Assignment +=</li>
      <li>Decrement and Assignment -=</li>
      <li>Multiply and Assignment *=</li>
      <li>Divide and Assignment /=</li>
      <li>Modolus and Assignment %=</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Relational or Comparison Operators</h2>
    <p>
      Relational operators are used for comparing values and the result of
      comparison is always either true or false. Relational operators shown
      below do implicit data type conversion of one of the operands before
      comparison
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Greater Than</li>
      <li>Greater than or equal to</li>
      <li>Lesser than</li>
      <li>Lesser than or equals to</li>
      <li>Equality</li>
      <li>Inequality</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Relational operators shown below compares both the values and the value
      types without any implicit type conversion
    </p>
    <p>
      Strict equality (===) and strict inequality (!==) operators consider only
      values of the same type to be equal. Hence, strict equality and strict
      inequality operators are highly recommended to determine whether two given
      values are equal or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: As a best practice, you should use === comparison operator when you
      want to compare value and type, and the rest of the places for value
      comparison == operator can be used.
    </p>
    <h4>Logical Operators</h4>
    <p>
      Logical operators allow a program to make a decision based on multiple
      conditions. Each operand is considered a condition that can be evaluated
      to true or false.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Logical NOT</li>
      <li>Logical AND</li>
      <li>Logical OR</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>"typeof" is an operator in JavaScript.</h3>
    <p>
      JavaScript is a loosely typed language i.e., the type of variable is
      decided at runtime based on the data assigned to it. This is also called
      dynamic data binding. As programmers, if required, the typeof operator can
      be used to find the data type of a JavaScript variable. The following are
      the ways in which it can be used and the corresponding results that it
      returns.
