    <h3>Operators in a programming language are the symbols used to perform</h3>
    <p>
      operations on the values. Operands: Represents the data. Operator:
      Performs certain operations on the operands.
    </p>
    <kbd>let sum = 5 + 10; </kbd>
    <p>
      The statement formed using the operator and the operands are called
      Expression. In the above example, 5+10 is an expression. The values are
      termed as operands. The symbol ‘+’ is the operator which indicates which
      operation needs to be performed.
    </p>
    <h2>Types of Operators</h2>
    <p>
      Operators are categorized into unary, binary, and ternary based on the
      number of operands on which they operate in an expression. JavaScript
      supports the following types of operators:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <b>Types of Operators</b>
      <li>Arithmatic Operator</li>
      <li>Assignment Operator</li>
      <li>Comparision Operator</li>
      <li>Logical</li>
      <li>Conditional</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Arithmatic Operator</h2>
    <p>
      Arithmetic operators are used for performing arithmetic operations like
      addition (+), substruction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), Modolus
      (%) and uniray operator like increment (++) and decrement (--)
    </p>

    <p>
      Arithmetic operator '+' when used with string type results in the
      concatenation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arithmetic operator ‘+’ when used with a string value and a numeric value,
      it results in a new string value.
