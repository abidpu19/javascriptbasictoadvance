    <h1>Data types in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      To be able to proceed with the manipulation of the data assigned to the
      variables, it is mandatory for a programming language to know the type of
      value or the type of data that the variable holds. That is because the
      operations or manipulations that must be applied on a variable will be
      specific to the type of data that a variable will hold. For example, the
      result of add operation on two variables will vary based on the fact
      whether the value of both the variables is numeric or textual. To handle
      such situation, data types are used.

    <h1>JavaScript defines the following data types:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Primitive Types
        <ul>
          <li>Number</li>
          <li>String</li>
          <li>Boolean</li>
          <li>null</li>
          <li>undefind</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Non Primitive Types
        <ul>
          <li>Object</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      The data is said to be primitive if it contains an individual value. Let
      us explore each of the primitive data types individually.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <b>Number</b> To store a variable that holds a numeric value, the
      primitive data type  number is used. In almost all the programming
      languages a number data type gets classified as shown below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>integer</li>
      <li>long</li>
      <li>float</li>
      <li>double</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But in JavaScript. the data type number is assigned to the values of type
      integer, long, float, and double. For example, the variable with number
      data type can hold values such as 300, 20.50, 10001, and 13456.89.
      Constant of type number can be declared like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      In JavaScript, any other value that does not belong to the above-mentioned
      types is not considered as a legal number. Such values are represented as
      NaN (Not-a-Number).
    </p>
    <h4>
      <b>String</b> When a variable is used to store textual value, a primitive
      data type string is used. Thus, the string represents textual values.
      String values are written in quotes, either single or double.
    </h4>
    <p>
      You can use quotes inside a string but that shouldn't match the quotes
      surrounding the string. Strings containing single quotes must be enclosed
      within double quotes and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will be interpreted as Rexha's and Rexha"s  respectively. Thus, use
      opposite quotes inside and outside of JavaScript single and double quotes.
      But if you use the same quotes inside a string and to enclose the string:
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a syntax error. Thus, remember, strings containing single quotes
      must be enlosed within double quotes and strings containing double quotes
      must be enclosed within single quotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To access any character within the string, it is important to be aware of
      its position in the string. The first character exists at index 0, next at
      index 1, and so on.
    </p>
    <h2>Literals</h2>
    <p>
      Literals can span multiple lines and interpolate expressions to include
      their results.
    </p>
    <kbd
      >let firstName="Kevin";  let lastName="Patrick"; console.log("Name:
      "+firstName+" "+lastName+"\n Email:"+firstName+"_"+lastName+"@abc.com");
      /* OUTPUT: Name: Kevin Patrick Email:Kevin_Patrick@abc.com  */
    </kbd>
    <p>
      Here, '+' is used for concatenation of identifiers and static content, and
      '\n' for a new line. To get the same output, literals can be used as shown
      below:
    </p>
    <kbd
      >let firstName="Kevin";  let lastName="Patrick";
      console.log(`Name:${firstName} ${lastName}
      Email: ${firstName}_${lastName}@abc.com`);  /* OUTPUT: Name: Kevin Patrick
      Email:Kevin_Patrick@abc.com  */
    </kbd>
    <p>
      Using template literal (`dfd`), multiple lines can be written in the
      console.log() in one go. So, the template literal notation enclosed in
      ``(backticks) makes it convenient to have multiline statements with
      expressions and the variables are accessed using ${} notation.
    </p>
    <h4>Boolean</h4>
    <p>
      When a variable is used to store a logical value that can always be true
      or false then, primitive data type Boolean is used. Thus, Boolean is a
      data type which represents only two values: true and false. Values such as
      100, -5, “Cat”, 107&lt;20, 1, 10*20+30, etc. evaluates to true whereas 0,
      “”, NaN, undefined, null, etc. evaluates to false.
    </p>
    <h4>Undefined</h4>
    <p>
      When the variable is used to store "no value", primitive data
      type undefined is used. Any variable that has not been assigned a value
      has the value undefined and such variable is of type undefined. The
      undefined value represents "no value".
    </p>
    <kbd> let custName; //here value and the data type are undefined  </kbd>
    <p>
      The JavaScript variable can be made empty by assigning the value
      undefined.
    </p>
    <kbd
      >let custName = "John"; //here value is John and the data type is
      String <br />
      custName = undefined; //here value and the data type are undefined </kbd
    >
    <h3>null</h3>
    <p>
      The null value represents "no object". Null data type is required as
      JavaScript variable intended to be assigned with the object at a later
      point in the program can be assigned null during the declaration.
    </p>
    <kbd
      >let item = null;   // variable item is intended to be assigned with
      object later. Hence null is assigned during variable declaration. 
    </kbd>
    <p>
      If required, the JavaScript variable can also be checked if it is pointing
      to a valid object or null.
    </p>
    <kbd>document.write(item==null);  </kbd>
    <p>
      <b> Note:</b> 'document' is an object that represents the HTML document
      rendered on the browser window and write() method helps one to populate
      HTML expressions or JavaScript code directly to the document.
    </p>

    <h3>BigInt</h3>
    <p>
      BigInt is a special numeric type that provides support for integers of
      random length. A BigInt is generated by appending n to the end of an
      integer literal or by calling the function BigInt that generates BigInt
      from strings, numbers, etc.
    </p>
    <kbd
      >const bigintvar = 67423478234689887894747472389477823647n; OR const
      bigintvar = BigInt("67423478234689887894747472389477823647"); const
      bigintFromNumber = BigInt(10); // same as 10n
    </kbd>
    <p>
      common math operations can be done on BigInt as regular numbers. But
      BigInt and regular numbers cannot be mixed in the expression.
    </p>
    <kbd
      >alert(3n + 2n); // 5 alert(7n / 2n); // 3 alert(8n + 2); // Error: Cannot
      mix BigInt and other types
    </kbd>
    <p>
      Here the division returns the result rounded towards zero, without the
      decimal part. Thus, all operations on BigInt return BigInt. BigInt and
      regular numbers must be explicitly converted using either BigInt() or
      Number(), as shown below: <b>Example:</b>
    </p>
    <kbd>
      let bigintvar = 6n; let numvar = 3; // number to bigint alert(bigintvar +
      BigInt(numvar)); // 9 // bigint to number alert(Number(bigintvar ) +
      numvar); // 9
    </kbd>
    <p>
      In the above example, if the bigintvar is too large that it won’t fit the
      number type, then extra bits will be cut off.
