    <h1>Data types in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
      To be able to proceed with the manipulation of the data assigned to the
      variables, it is mandatory for a programming language to know the type of
      value or the type of data that the variable holds. That is because the
      operations or manipulations that must be applied on a variable will be
      specific to the type of data that a variable will hold. For example, the
      result of add operation on two variables will vary based on the fact
      whether the value of both the variables is numeric or textual. To handle
      such situation, data types are used.

    <h1>JavaScript defines the following data types:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Primitive Types
        <ul>
          <li>Number</li>
          <li>String</li>
          <li>Boolean</li>
          <li>null</li>
          <li>undefind</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Non Primitive Types
        <ul>
          <li>Object</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      The data is said to be primitive if it contains an individual value. Let
      us explore each of the primitive data types individually.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <b>Number</b> To store a variable that holds a numeric value, the
      primitive data type  number is used. In almost all the programming
      languages a number data type gets classified as shown below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>integer</li>
      <li>long</li>
      <li>float</li>
      <li>double</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But in JavaScript. the data type number is assigned to the values of type
      integer, long, float, and double. For example, the variable with number
      data type can hold values such as 300, 20.50, 10001, and 13456.89.
      Constant of type number can be declared like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      In JavaScript, any other value that does not belong to the above-mentioned
      types is not considered as a legal number. Such values are represented as
      NaN (Not-a-Number).
    </p>
    <h4>
      <b>String</b> When a variable is used to store textual value, a primitive
      data type string is used. Thus, the string represents textual values.
      String values are written in quotes, either single or double.
    </h4>
    <p>
      You can use quotes inside a string but that shouldn't match the quotes
      surrounding the string. Strings containing single quotes must be enclosed
      within double quotes and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will be interpreted as Rexha's and Rexha"s  respectively. Thus, use
      opposite quotes inside and outside of JavaScript single and double quotes.
      But if you use the same quotes inside a string and to enclose the string:
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a syntax error. Thus, remember, strings containing single quotes
      must be enlosed within double quotes and strings containing double quotes
      must be enclosed within single quotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To access any character within the string, it is important to be aware of
      its position in the string. The first character exists at index 0, next at
      index 1, and so on.
